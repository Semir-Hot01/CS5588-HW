Since the assingment was to refine a model I went back and used an older version of a model that I created for this project that was up and coming, Initally the results were awful and none of the prices were even close. Running a Gridserch to get a better understanding of what paramters to pass in really helped my model out quite a bit as you can see in the result below. There are still some outliars that need to be figured but some of them were right on the money when it came to predicting the price. This moving foward will help us tune our model so that it will be able to predict future prices with the training it gets here. Again this is a old version that I wrote and not the one the group made, this was my idea drafting model.
