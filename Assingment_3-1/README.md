Going into this assignment I started last week in class on doing hyper parameter tuning on my model. I just did a quick version of this since we did not have a lot of time in class to be able to set up a large search area and have the code run for an extended period of time. What I wanted to do for this assignment was not change anything on the data or modeling style but I wanted to expand my grid/parameter search to see if I am able to get better performance out of the model. Again this is the model that i wrote to pitch to my team as an idea, and the one that I worked off in class with a basic hyper parameter search. With this one I expanded the search area out and improved the methods that I was using. I was able to get some better results then previous testing but something I did not show case was new features that are going to be used in the df. I will be using them in the new assignment for the team.
